These agents can also use facial displays and nonverbal behavior to provide simulated empathic responses to help patients feel understood."

    title="COVID Vaccination"
    img="/SCC.webp"
    desc="Participated in  developing a smartphone-based conversational agent intervention to promote COVID-19 vaccination among members of predominately African American churches. The intervention is based on the stages-of-change (transtheoretical) model, incoporating elements of motivational interviewing for those who are vaccine hesistant. The agent and its messaging are culturally tailored for members of the churches we are working with, and addresses misconceptions and myths about COVID-19 and available vaccines. For users who are fully-vaccinated, the agent counsels them on how to talk to their friends and family about vaccination."
