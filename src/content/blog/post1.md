- My research interests lie in creating engaging and supportive environments that promote independence and
enhance the quality of life for older adults. Having provided a decade of care for my grandfather with
Alzheimer's and sharing a profound bond with my grandmother, I've witnessed firsthand the challenges of
aging. This intimate affection fuels my determination to contribute meaningful research that could alleviate
such struggles.
- The Law and Medicine studies during my undergraduate journey exposed me to complex healthcare issues,
such as end-of-life decisions and organ transplantation, deepening my understanding of the ethical dilemmas
faced by patients and healthcare professionals. While we cannot solve the dilemmas, I believe technology
can play an important role in alleviating physical and emotional suffering in these challenging situations. The
global pandemic has proved the significance of technology in healthcare, with the widespread adoption
of mobile and web applications for remote healthcare services. This highlighted the need for accessible and
effective self-help tools.
